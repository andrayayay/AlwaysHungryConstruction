This is my first freelance project. I partnered up with a food truck to create them an awesome website with also the opportunity to maintain it. My first step was to createn them a "under construction" site to be deployed to their domain - bealwayshungry.com. I decided it was best that I use github for this project so I can keep track of my progress and be able to revert back to an old verison if neccessary. 

My goal for this under construction site was to keep it simple. I displayed their logo in the navbar where it will most likely be when the official website is deployed. I wanted to display a "coming soon" message along with social media icons that link to all their social media accounts. I also wanted to give an opportunity for people who may come across this site to be able to keep in contact by giving their full name and email address. Lastly a footer with copyright, company's name, and my partner and I's.

From this experience, I now have a firm grasp on media queries. I made a separtate CSS file for media queries to keep myself organized. The console became by best friend since I could see what my website would look like on all devices.
